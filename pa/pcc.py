Provides pcc function to estimate Pearson Correlation Coefficients (PCC)

Date:    2019-04-25
Authors: Renaud Pacalet, renaud.pacalet@telecom-paris.fr

The Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) is a statistical tool to evaluate the
linear correlation between two random variables. The formula of a PCC between
random variables X and Y is:

PCC(X,Y) = [E(X*Y) - E(X)*E(Y)] / [s(X) * s(Y)]

where E(Z) is the expectation (average value) of random variable Z and s(Z) is
its standard deviation. The value of the PCC is in range -1 to +1. Values close
to 0 indicate no or a weak linear correlation. Values close to -1 or +1
indicate strong linear correlations.

The basic form of the pcc function computes an estimate of PCC(X,Y), the
Pearson Correlation Coefficient between two scalar random variables X and Y. It
computes the estimate from two samples of X and Y. The samples must contain the
same number N of observations, with N>=2. The samples are passed as two lists
of N numbers:

x = [0]*N
y = [0]*N
p = 0
...
p = pcc.pcc(x,y)

The returned value is a floating point number between -1.0 and 1.0.

In a second form the pcc function computes the K estimates of PCC(X,Yk),
0<=k<K. The Yk are K distinct scalar random variables. Their samples are passed
as a list of K lists of N>=2 numbers each, where N is the length of the
sublists and also of the list representing the sample of X. This second form
returns the list of the K PCC estimates:

x = [0]*N
y = [[0]*N for k in range(K)]
p = [0]*K
...
p = pcc.pcc(x,y)

A third and fourth forms are the equivalents of the two first forms but where X
is a L-components vector random variable. The PCC estimates are computed
component-wise of X:

x = [[0]*L for n in range(N)]
y = [0]*N
z = [[0]*N for k in range(K)]
pxy = [0]*L
pxz = [[0]*L for k in range(K)]
...
pxy = pcc.pcc(x,y)
pxz = pcc.pcc(x,z)

All forms return a list of lists.

Usage:
    import pcc

    x0 = [0]*N
    x1 = [[0]*L for n in range(N)]
    y0 = [0]*N
    y1 = [[0]*N for k in range(K)]
    px0y0 = [[0]]
    px0y1 = [[0]*K]
    px1y0 = [[0]*L]
    px1y1 = [[0]*L for k in range(K)]
    ...
    px0y0 = pcc.pcc(x0,y0)
    px0y1 = pcc.pcc(x0,y1)
    px1y0 = pcc.pcc(x1,y0)
    px1y1 = pcc.pcc(x1,y1)

Raises:
    TypeError: x,y lengths mismatch (first form)
    TypeError: x,y-sub-lists lengths mismatch (second form)
    TypeError: x not list of floats and not list of lists of floats
    TypeError: y not list of floats and not list of lists of floats
    ValueError: length of x < 2
    ValueError: x variance estimate=0 (constant x?)
    ValueError: y variance estimate=0 (constant y?)

Note:
    The second and fourth forms are equivalent to:
        p = map(lambda z:pcc.pcc(x,z),y)
    but are much more efficient.
