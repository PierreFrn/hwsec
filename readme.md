Archive of the Hardware Security course labs at Eurecom.

my solutions are the [ta.py](/ta/ta.py) and [pa.py](/pa/pa.py) respectively for
the timing attack lab on a DES software implementation and
the power attack lab on a DES crypto accelerator.

The readme's in each folder explain in what consisted the labs.
At the end of said readme's, there is a link to the corresponding hall of fame, my score are written as "Pierre F." and dated in June of 2022.

Thank you, to Mr Pacalet (renaud.pacalet@telecom-paris.fr) for giving me the authorization to upload this repo publicly.
